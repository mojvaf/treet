## Working with data

#### I have built an animated and interactive scatter plot using D three.

#### I worked with data which came from Boston housing data set.

_HousingData.csv_

###### The data has 8 columns and 507 rows and it shows the relationship between the value of the house

###### and the wealth. The orange dots show the distance between the house and Charles river.
